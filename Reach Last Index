Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.

For example, [2, 0, 1, 0] returns True while [1, 1, 0, 1] returns False.

// We can solve this by using the sum of the indexes to move a pointer forward.
// If the pointer is the final index then that means we have successfully reached the last index.
// If the pointer does not reach the end that means it had nothing to add to the pointer the current value would be 0

function reachLastIndex(arr) {
  let pointer = 0;
  let current = arr[0];

  while (pointer <= arr.length - 1) {
    if (current > 0) {
      pointer += current;
      current = arr[pointer];
      if (pointer === arr.length - 1) return true;
    } else if (current === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
console.log(reachLastIndex([2, 0, 1, 0]));
console.log(reachLastIndex([1, 1, 0, 1]));
