This problem was asked by Google.

Given two strings A and B, return whether or not A can be shifted some number of times to get B.

For example, if A is abcde and B is cdeab, return true. If A is abc and B is acb, return false.

// If we combined the first string we would get every possibility of string rotations (shifting one letter at a time).
// Therefore if the second string is a substring of the combination. 


function checkValidRotation(str1, str2) {
  if (str1.length !== str2.length) return false;

  const joinedStr = str1 + str1;

  return joinedStr.includes(str2);
}

console.log(checkValidRotation("abcde", "cdeab"));
